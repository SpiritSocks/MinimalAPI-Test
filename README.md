#Minimal API Test Project

Overview
--------
This project is a Minimal API developed as a learning exercise following the official .NET Minimal APIs tutorial. The goal was to understand the fundamentals of building lightweight APIs using ASP.NET Core.

Key Features
--------
CRUD Operations: Implemented basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing data.

Entity Framework Core Integration: Utilized EF Core for database interactions.

Dependency Injection: Applied DI principles to manage service lifetimes and dependencies.

Routing and Endpoints: Configured concise routing for API endpoints.

Learning Outcomes
---------
Understanding Minimal APIs: Gained insights into setting up and configuring Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core.

Database Connectivity: Learned how to integrate and interact with a database using Entity Framework Core.

Middleware Configuration: Explored the setup and customization of middleware components in the request pipeline.

Testing and Debugging: Practiced debugging techniques and wrote unit tests to ensure API reliability.

Next Steps
----------
Authentication and Authorization: Plan to implement JWT-based authentication to secure endpoints.

Validation: Add data validation to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages.

Logging: Integrate logging mechanisms to monitor and troubleshoot the application.

Acknowledgments
----------
Special thanks to the .NET documentation team for providing comprehensive and accessible tutorials that guided this project.
